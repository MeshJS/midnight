## Contract Selection Tips

### Single Contract Projects
Perfect for focused applications or proof-of-concepts. Select one contract type and build a specialized solution.

### Multi-Contract Projects
Combine multiple contracts for complex dApps. For example:
- **Tokenization + Oracle** - Real-world asset pricing
- **Staking + Identity** - Governance with verified participants
- **Lending + Oracle** - Price-aware DeFi protocols

### All Contracts
Select all contracts to explore the full ecosystem or build a comprehensive platform.

## Technical Details

Each contract includes:
- Complete `.compact` source files
- Compiled TypeScript interfaces
- ZK circuit configurations
- Build and deployment scripts
- Example usage documentation
