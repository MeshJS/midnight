## üì± Overview
This repository features a fully functional decentralized application (DApp) built with Midnight technology that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to securely authenticate users bidding on house sales. It integrates smart contracts written in Midnight‚Äôs Compact language to generate proofs verifying aspects of a digital identity, and it boasts a sleek, modern, and intuitive user interface designed to provide an exceptional user experience. The application connects seamlessly with Lace Wallet, uses mocked off-chain data for demonstration purposes, and includes sections for minting the token necessary to perform bids, an administration section for administering bidding rooms, and a user section where users place bids and authenticate themselves.

## üìá Purpose of the DApp
- We've worked hard to make this repository easy to use, enabling every developer to deploy their own application with their own tokens. By integrating Ngrok, developers can quickly launch their applications, share them with friends and colleagues, and iterate rapidly. This repository is dedicated to education and accelerated development.
- Demonstrate Midnight's capabilities of performing restrictive logic on a decentralized ledger based on private information.
- Demonstrate how decentralized identity can be seamlessly integrated within the Midnight platform.
- Showcase the necessity and effective use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to prove information without revealing it, ensuring privacy and trustlessness.
- Highlight Midnight's ability to enable the development of end-to-end decentralized applications that combine secure computation, privacy, and usability.

## üìú How to use the platform
This auction platform offers a decentralized, secure, and transparent bidding experience without relying on traditional web2 authentication, ensuring that your private data remains protected. Instead, it uses the Coin public key for user authentication, along with decentralized identifiers issued by authorized issuers (stored in a local database) for access control and identity verification. The platform is structured to provide distinct functionalities for administrators, regular users, and token minting, while delivering a sleek, intuitive, and engaging user interface. We've put a lot of effort into the details to ensure the experience is not only secure but also easy to use and visually appealing.

### Admin
- Administrators can open bidding rooms for auctions by setting details such as the bid title, description, house image, and minimum bid‚Äîall securely recorded on the blockchain for full transparency. They also specify the opening and closing times for each room to establish a clear auction timeline.
- Start and close bidding rooms.
- Approve certificate hashes from registered users‚Äîthese hashes can later be verified with the issuer without revealing any additional information. The administrator will only check that the hash is valid and was emitted by an authorized issuer by confirming its existence, ensuring that no further details are disclosed and that private information remains secure.
- When a bidding room is closed, the administrator collects the accumulated funds for future management.
- This feature is available to all users, so any user who creates a bidding room automatically gains administrator privileges.

### Users 
- Users can register for any open bidding room as long as they possess an identifier that complies with the bidding room's requirements. For this auction platform, users must meet four prerequisites: they must be the owner of the certificate (controlled by the Coin Public Key), be over 18 years old, AML compliant, and free of any issues with local jurisdiction regulations.
- In this version of the platform, we are using mock data that includes four different certificates‚Äîsome that meet all prerequisites for testing and others that do not. Despite using simulated data, we have designed the architecture to support integration with various issuers and decentralized identity frameworks. This is detailed in the arquitecture section, which lays the foundation for future work streams. 
- Once a bidding room is closed to new registrations, continue to place bids during the auction.
- Place bids that must exceed the previous highest bid, with the contract refunding the prior highest bid to its owner.

### Minting
- Mint the token necessary for placing bids.
- Each token costs 1 tDUST, and tokens can be minted in chunks of 100, provided that the user has sufficient tDUST available.
- The owner of the bidding tokens can withdraw the funds accumulated in the treasury from the sale of bidding tokens.

## üî® Build

### Prerequisites

- [Midnight Compact compiler](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/tutorial/building/prereqs#midnight-compact-compiler)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Compiler configuration:

- Ensure your compact compiler environment variable is configured by running:
```shell
     echo $COMPACT_HOME
     compactc --version
```    
- If nothing is returned, add the following line to your bashrc file (Linux), making sure to update the path to your compact binaries location:
```shell
    export COMPACT_HOME="<YOUR-COMPACT-COMPILER-LOCATION>"
    export PATH="$COMPACT_HOME:$PATH"
```

### Build the repository
```shell
    yarn 
    yarn build
```

## ‚öóÔ∏è Test

```shell
    npx turbo test
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Run locally - Standalone Network
- **Initialize Network Variables:** Update "my_own_wallet" variable with your own wallet address from Lace Wallet:
    - [prepare-local-standalone-env.test.ts](token-api/src/test/prepare-local-standalone-env.test.ts)      
- **Initialize Midnight instances and token smart contract.** Make sure to have docker engine running.
```shell
    yarn environment
```
- **Initialize UI Variables:** Create a .env file at the ui-pages level based on the [.env.example](ui-pages/.env.example). The PostgreSQL password will be generated in the next step, so just copy the format provided in the .env.example file. Optionally, insert your Blockfrost key. The token smart contract address was generated and displayed in the console when you ran "yarn environment"‚Äîsimply copy the address  and paste it into your .env file<br>

- **Initialize UI server and Postgres Database.** Running Ngrok is Optional (domain need to be updated in the package.json):
```shell
    cd ui-pages 
    yarn dev

## üéá Arquitecture
Below is an overview of how Midnight technology integrates with authorized issuers and various decentralized identity frameworks, as illustrated in the attached diagram.

The architecture features three main participants: the Issuer, the User, and the DApp. The Issuer plays a critical role by performing various off-chain checks‚Äîsuch as wallet verification, KYC, and AML‚Äîto act as a robust identity verifier. In doing so, it supports multiple identity frameworks, including Identus and KERI. The issuer issues hashed certificates that prove user attributes (such as age, AML compliance, or local jurisdiction clearance) and stores these certificate hashes in an Issuer Smart Contract, marking them as valid or revoked. No personal information is exposed in this process; only the hash and its status are recorded, ensuring that sensitive data remains private.

On the user side, individuals hold their private certificates and utilize Midnight‚Äôs zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) circuits to demonstrate compliance without revealing any underlying personal data. When interacting with the DApp Smart Contract, they reference the valid certificate hashes from the Issuer Smart Contract to prove their eligibility‚Äîfor example, to participate in auctions or access specific features‚Äîwhile keeping all confidential information hidden.

The DApp relies on these ZKP proofs to verify that a user meets the necessary requirements without ever handling sensitive data directly. Cross-smart-contract communication allows the DApp to confirm the validity of certificate hashes and any associated revocations, guaranteeing that only legitimate certificates are used.

By employing Midnight technology, this system preserves privacy by only sharing proof of compliance, enhances security through cryptographic verification of certificate hashes and ZKPs, and maintains decentralization by storing the relevant data and logic on-chain. The platform‚Äôs design offers flexibility for integrating with multiple identity frameworks‚Äîenabling a wide range of future use cases that benefit from verifiable and privacy-preserving identity solutions.

Midnight‚Äôs Compact language also provides primitives for digital signature verification within ZK circuits. In this particular setup, digital signature checks are not strictly necessary because cross-smart-contract communication handles the validation. This approach reduces the complexity and cost of the circuits while supporting the critical ability to revoke signatures‚Äîa key feature for decentralized identity scenarios where certificates may need to be invalidated without revealing sensitive details.

</div>

### Workspaces
The auction platform is powered by two distinct smart contracts: one mints the token required to place a bid, and the other handles the auction/identity logic. The repository is organized into workspaces, each dedicated to a specific phase or contract:

- **`token-contract`**: Phase#1 implementation for token contract.
- **`token-api`**: Phase#2 implementation for token contract.
- **`auction-contract`**: Phase#1 implementation for auction/identity contract.
- **`auction-api`**: Phase#2 implementation for auction/identity contract.
- **`compact`**: Wrapper of Compact compiler.
- **`ui-pages`**: Phase#3 and Phase#4 for token and auction/identity contract.

## üåü Innovation - Pushing the boundaries
- **`Mesh SDK for Midnight:`** 
A groundbreaking development is the creation of the Mesh SDK - Midnight package, which is designed to simplify the development process for business developers. For this project, we have delivered a wallet widget that allows developers to plug and play a complete, working wallet component directly into their applications. The SDK will be deployed in four distinct phases, explained above in the Development Process section, enabling developers to engage at various levels of abstraction according to their expertise and needs. Notably, phase #4 of the SDK for the auction & token contract provides ready-to-use providers and hooks. This means that developers do not need to grasp the underlying intricacies of Midnight technology‚Äîunderstanding the business logic and having basic React knowledge is sufficient. This phased approach balances flexibility with readiness, fostering a more accessible and robust development ecosystem on the Midnight platform.

- **`Developer-Friendly Repository for Education and Rapid Development:`** 
We understand the challenges new developers face when setting up, testing, and running decentralized applications. To address these pain points, this repository is built with a strong focus on education and rapid local development. Developers can quickly get the application running on their local machines without the need to host or sign up with any cloud provider. With NGROK integration, sharing the application with friends and other developers is seamless, eliminating traditional barriers and accelerating the learning process. No more pain testing Midnight functionalities‚Äîjust plug in, start learning, and iterate.

- **`Robust Revocation Logic Without Digital Signatures:`** 
Our design intentionally avoids relying on digital signature verification within the zero-knowledge circuits, as digital signatures are effective for validating data integrity but do not offer a mechanism for revoking certificates. Recognizing the necessity of a revocation process in decentralized identity management, revocation is currently performed manually by the administrator, who checks the issuer's list of approved certificate hashes. In a future work stream, we plan to integrate automated revocation logic through cross-contract communication. This approach allows any certificate to be promptly revoked when necessary while avoiding the additional overhead and compatibility challenges that come with incorporating diverse cryptographic primitives, thereby maintaining both security and efficiency.

- **`Integrated Token-Based Bidding:`** 
Both smart contracts are seamlessly integrated so that the tokens minted by the Token Smart Contract serve as the exclusive currency for placing bids. No other coins are accepted, ensuring a consistent and secure economic model throughout the auction process.

- **`Certificate Ownership Binding:`** 
Each certificate is tied to the owner's coin public key and is verified within the circuit. This binding means that even if a certificate is compromised, it cannot be misused unless the attacker also controls the corresponding Midnight wallet, thereby exponentially enhancing security and identity control.

- **`Automated Treasury Management:`** 
The token smart contract not only mints and manages bidding tokens but also includes a treasury mechanism, allowing the owner to withdraw accumulated funds at any time for streamlined financial oversight.

- **`Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Identity Verification:`**
Implementing ZKP circuits with Midnight technology allows us to verify user attributes and eligibility without exposing sensitive personal data.

- **`Decentralized Identity Integration:`** 
The platform supports various decentralized identity frameworks (such as KERI and Identus) and leverages off-chain checks (KYC, AML, wallet verification) to ensure robust identity verification.

- **`Intuitive User Interface & Experience:`** 
A sleek and engaging UI has been developed to make the platform accessible and user-friendly, ensuring that both administrators and participants can navigate complex decentralized processes with ease.

- **`Robust Testing Framework:`** 
A comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and simulation tests validates the functionality and security of the smart contracts, maintaining the platform's reliability and integrity as it evolves.

- **`Future-Ready Architecture:`** 
Designed for scalability and adaptability, the architecture lays a solid foundation for integrating additional identity frameworks and advanced automation features in future iterations.


## üìã Contract Features
The platform leverages a set of smart contracts that provide core functionalities for decentralized auctions and identity verification. These features are organized into three main areas:

### Token Smart Contract:
The Token Smart Contract is responsible for minting and managing the tokens necessary for placing bids. It enforces a fixed token cost (e.g., 1 tDUST per token) and supports minting in predetermined batch sizes, ensuring users have the required tokens to participate in auctions. Additionally, this contract manages a treasury, allowing the owner to withdraw funds at any time, thus streamlining the financial management of the platform.

- Contract Control 
    ```typescript
    export ledger counter: Counter;
    export ledger nonce: Bytes<32>;
    export ledger tvl_token: Uint<64>;

    export ledger reward: QualifiedCoinInfo;  
    export ledger tvl_dust: Uint<64>;
    export sealed ledger owner_public_key: ZswapCoinPublicKey;
    ```
    ```typescript
    assert coin.value == 100000000 "requires 100 * 1000000 t-dust";
    assert coin.color == native_token() "Invalid coin provided";

    export sealed ledger owner_public_key: ZswapCoinPublicKey; //This is being controled by the owner's ZswapCoinPublicKey and checked by a circuit

    constructor(initNonce: Bytes<32>) {
    nonce = initNonce;
     owner_public_key = own_public_key();
    } //The owner is initialized only during the contract deployment and it is protected by the sealed command

    const send_result =  send(reward, left<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>(owner_public_key), reward.value); //The contract handles a treasury and only pays to the owner
    ```

- Circuits
    ```typescript
    export circuit mint(coin: CoinInfo): [] {...}
    export circuit owner_withdraw(): [] {...}
    ```

### Auction/Identity Smart Contract
The Auction/Identity Smart Contract handles the core auction logic, including the creation and management of bidding rooms, the verification of user eligibility via certificate hashes, and the processing of bids. It integrates decentralized identity verification by ensuring that only users meeting the defined criteria‚Äîsuch as age, AML compliance, and jurisdiction requirements‚Äîcan participate. The contract also manages the approval and rejection of registration hashes. While this process is currently performed manually by the administrator, it can be optimized for automation once cross-contract communication capabilities are available in Midnight. Furthermore, the contract handles bid refunds to previous highest bidders, all while maintaining transparency and security on-chain.

An interesting feature incorporated into the auction module is that each certificate is bound to the owner's coin public key, which is verified within the circuit. This means that even if a user loses control of the certificate, it cannot be exploited unless the entity also controls the corresponding user's Midnight wallet. This design significantly enhances the security of the platform and reinforces identity control.

- Witness Control: 
    ```typescript
    witness local_secret_certificate(): Certificate;  //The certificate holds information such as age, AML, jurisdictions, owner ZswapCoinPK, issuer and SK
    ```  
- Contract Control 
    ```typescript
    export sealed ledger reward_coin_color: Bytes<32>; 
    export sealed ledger admin_public_key: ZswapCoinPublicKey;
    export ledger registered_hashes: Map<Bytes<32>, Boolean>;

    export ledger state: STATE;
    export sealed ledger title: Opaque<"string">;
    export sealed ledger description: Opaque<"string">;
    export sealed ledger estimatedValue: Uint<128>;
    export sealed ledger deadline: Opaque<"string">;
    export sealed ledger image: Opaque<"string">;

    export ledger instance: Counter;
    export ledger highest_bidder: Maybe<ZswapCoinPublicKey>;
    export ledger highest_bid: Uint<128>; 
    export ledger treasury: QualifiedCoinInfo;
    export ledger treasury_balance: Uint<128>;

    constructor(token_address: ContractAddress, title_: Opaque<"string">, description_: Opaque<"string">, estimatedValue_: Uint<128>, deadline_: Opaque<"string">, image_: Opaque<"string">) {...}

    assert (admin_public_key == own_public_key()) "You are not the admin";
    assert (state == STATE.open) "The auction is not open";
    assert (state == STATE.active) "The auction has not yet started"; 
    assert (certificate.age > 18) "You must be over 18 to participate";
    assert (certificate.aml == true) "You must be AML compliance to participate";
    assert (certificate.jurisdiction == true) "You must be jurisdiction compliance to participate";
    assert (certificate.owner == own_public_key()) "You must be the owner of the certificate to register";
    assert (registered_hashes.member(registration_hash(certificate))) "You are not registered";
    assert (registered_hashes.lookup(registration_hash(certificate)) == true) "Your registration is not approved";
    assert (coin.color == reward_coin_color) "Invalid coin provided"; 
    assert (coin.value > highest_bid) "requires to be higher than previous bid";

    send(treasury, left<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>(highest_bidder.value), treasury.value);  //the contract always return the balance of the previous highest bidder automatically when a highest bid is placed.
    ```  

- Circuits
    ```typescript
    export circuit start_bid(): [] {...}
    export circuit close_bid(): [] {...}
    export circuit approve_certificates(approved_hashes: Vector<10, Maybe<Bytes<32>>>): [] {...}
    export circuit register(): [] {...}
    export circuit make_bid(coin: CoinInfo): [] {...}
    ```

### Test Framework
The Test Framework module rigorously validates the functionality of both the Token and Auction/Identity smart contracts. It comprises unit tests, integration tests, and simulation scenarios to ensure that the contracts perform as expected under various conditions. This framework is essential for maintaining the reliability, security, and overall integrity of the platform as it evolves.

## üõ†Ô∏è Findings or Improvements

### Phase#1 Succeeds but Phase#2 Fails:
- merge_coin Functionality: When using merge_coin together with CoinInfo and Write_coin, the Phase 1 test passes, but Phase 2 fails.
- Circuit Sizes: Phase1 does not take this in consideration.
- Testing Framework Limitations: Phase 1 only considers private states and the logic derived from coins received through circuits. The testing framework does not account for ZswapCoinPks (which are populated with zeros in every case) and does not track any Zswap coin balances.

### Coins Lost or Not Tracked by the Wallet:
- If the Kachina proof is generated and the transaction is signed, an immediate browser refresh causes the wallet to lose track of coin balances. However, if you wait until both proofs (Kachina and Zwap) are generated, this issue does not occur.

### General Issues:
- Next App Router not compatible with some Midnight Libraries, specifically the public provider.
- New versions released with examples 0.2.0 are failing when minting tokens.
